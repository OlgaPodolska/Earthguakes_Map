# Mapping_Earthquakes
GeoJSON data to create interactive earthquake map

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world, as well as the tectonic plates around the globe. Earthquakes used for the last seven days using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of all earthquakes and large earthquakes for the last seven days.

# Results

To complete this project, we used a GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. We then add the data to a map, including various different map styles. We also allow the user to toggle the earthquake markers or tectonic plate lines on-and-off.
